# LLM_Document_Summariser

## Introduction
This project was created as part of an assignment to summarise law judgements. However, the methodology used can be applied to any text that needs to be summarised. What is showcased here is an automated document summariser pipeline that leverages LLM and the LangChain library as the mainstay summary tools. The LLM of choice here is Google's LLM text-bison which is well suited for summarisation tasks.

## Methodology
There are 3 main steps which span the pipeline, namely Pre-processing, In-processing, and Post-processing. These steps will be further elaborated below.
